## Create Your Own N-body Simulation (With Python)

Simulate orbits of stars interacting due to gravity

Code calculates pairwise forces according to Newton's Law of Gravity

To run with the default simulation:
```
python nbody.py
```

The default simulation uses a drift-kick time integrator to update particle positions and velocities and produces the following image:
