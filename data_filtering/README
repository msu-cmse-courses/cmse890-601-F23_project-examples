The datasets used in this example are based off the Great British Baking Show.
The data was originally made available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
as the [bakeoff package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bakeoff/index.html).

It was downloaded as CSVs from this [list of R sample datasets](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html).
This website also has notes about the format of [bakers_raw.csv](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/bakeoff/bakers_raw.html) and [results_raw.csv](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/bakeoff/results_raw.html).

The script `filter_stars.py` counts how many times a contestant was deemed the "star baker" for the week
and identifies whether or not they subsequently won that season's competition. Given that the show is British,
each season is instead called a "series".

The original datasets can be artificially inflated using the Pandas `tile` and `repeat` functions.
