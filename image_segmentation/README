Before running `python remove_background.py`, you'll need to download the [COIL-100 dataset](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php).

To download and extract the compressed dataset on the HPCC, run
```bash
wget http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/SLAM_coil-20_coil-100/coil-100/coil-100.zip
unzip coil-100.zip
```
